This is a security vulnerablity i’ve found on facebook, however they have claimed this to be duplicate, even though i was the first and second reporter. (Both tickets were mine, and I proved it but they’ve then told this does not qualify LOL)

– They have anyway did some changes in the DMARC policy that blocks sending of mails through a *support.facebook.com address, anyway it’s still possible to receive.

```
Vulnerability Scope
Main Site (www.facebook.com)

Title
Email Takeover [Facebook]

Product/URL
Facebook.com

Description and Impact
I was checking through my support cases in facebook, and i suddenly found that the reply email looks something like: case++aazq51151516wyd4@support.facebook.com my brain quickly came up with an idea of trying to register the email address in GMAIL, i went to gmail and registered the facebook email address through “Create an account option” in gmail, and it showed that “it sent me a confirmation email” i refreshed my support ticket of facebook! and i was shocked to see the confirmation link waiting for me, i confirmed, and now i have an email ending with @support.facebook.com.

Reproduction Instructions/Proof of Concept
1) Create a facebook support ticket,
2) Copy the Reply-to address of the email (ex: case++aa1aaa1511514@support.facebook.com) from the email you recieve on your mail account about support ticket creation.
3) Go to Gmail, Create an account with your new email address as the Reply-to address. (ex: case++aaaaaqy141414141@support.facebook.com)
4) Come back to the ticket, and confirm the ownership…
5) Done, you now own a @support.facebook.com email address =)

Impacts Of The Issue:
1) A person can easily disguise as a support staff of facebook with this email.
2) Misuse of corporate email
