I was able to takeover accounts of vanilla forum users/including admins who used the SSO library feature of Vanilla forums…. this was a simple bug…

Vanilla have their private program in hackerone, so you can only participate if you are invited.

If you integrate your game/website with vanilla forums through SSO library, and if you are not having email confirmation enabled, you can login/takeover into any account.

Actually, when it comes to vanilla, the email_id field is the primary key, and acts as the primary identity of the user….

 

//My hacker1 report.

```
the product on he above URL is using a paid version of vanilla (premium) which is managed and engineered by vanilla, and it is interconnected with their game Vanilla provides library for interconnecting their between game and forums.

I’ve found a account takeover bug in this.. If you know someone’s email, you can just create a game account with that email on another server, and load forums from ingame, which will give you access to their forum account, A.K.A forum account takeover.

Attack Scenario:

1) Tim wants to hack John, Tim knows that john’s forum account’s email ID is john@test.com
2) Tim goes to game link, changes server to International-1 creates an account with email john@test.com
3) Tim loads the forum through the ingame-button available,
5) Tim succesfully gets into John’s forum account.

My assumption is that this bug happens because the library provided by Vanilla for connecting between game/forum is having a big problem, it checks accounts based on the email (i.e: email is probably the primary_Key field), the library has the bug,

Many vanilla premium products use this library, so this has to be fixed, as it is on many of your products. this challenges the reputation of vanilla boards.


Impact
Risks:

1) Account can be takeovered.
2) Possible to gain access to admin account, in this case, admin@site.com is the admin’s email.
3) Messages can be read.
4) Messages can be sent
5) Discussions can be post.
