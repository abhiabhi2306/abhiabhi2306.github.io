Today, we are going to pwn Pumpkin Festival from Vulnhub.

# Nmap

Starting off with the nmap using `nmap -sV -sC -A -p- -T5 192.168.43.17` reveals that we have FTP, HTTP and SSH at 6880.

# Tokens

From the first discovery I found that flag are named as token and that is our challenge i.e. finding all tokens.

#### First

First one was at the botttom of the HTML page can be viewed upon inspection of the page.

#### Second

With the result of nmap scan we seen that anaonymous login is open. Using the package `ftp` we logged into the machine and  in the directory named secret we found a file named `token.txt` having the second token.

#### Third

This one requires bruteforcing the FTP service in order to get token, as we have inspected HTTP client for first we saw that there is a user named harry. On the basis of that assumption, using `hydra -l harry -P rockyou.txt 192.168.43.17 ftp -t 60`, it will take some time so don't get impatient.

Password of user **harry**:-

Logging in with user **harry** shows that we have a `token.txt` and a directory named `Donotopen`. Get the token and start changing directories.

#### Forth          

While logged in FTP, and chanaging bunch **NO** named nested directories, we get another token and a `data.txt`.

>PumpkinToken : f9c5053d01e0dfc30066476ab0f0564c

That `data.txt` was a tar file which can be confirmed using `file data.txt`. 

Extracting it gives a hex encoded OpenSSL Private Key.

#### Fifth

Checking `robots.txt` on a HTTP we get see a `/tarck/track.txt`, going to that webpage we see:-

Hey Jack!

Thanks for choosing our local store. Hope you like the services.

admin@pumpkins.local

***

`admin@pumpkins.local` seems interesting, editing the hosts file we add `pumpkia.local`. After this, we get a wordpress temed website. Using wpscan doesn't give any interesting results. So, using dirb we see a lot of pages which can be seen at any normal wordpress website.

Going to `readme.html` it shows a base?? encoded data, using CyberChef and trying multiple bases we can see it's a base64 data which decodes to credentails.

>morse & jack : Ug0t!TrIpyJ

So, logging into the wordpress with as morse we see that there is a flag in biographical info.

#### Sixth

Now, so we had a OpenSSL private key, we can use it to get into the machine via SSH as jack with `ssh -i key jack@192.168.43.17 -p 6880` we get into the system.

![](/img/Pumpkin-Festival/ssh.png)

In the home directory we can see a ELF named token, running it we can get our seventh token.

>PumpkinToken : 8d66ef0055b43d80c34917ec6c75f706


# Root

Using wordpress credentials for jack we can use sudo. Using `sudo -l` we can see that creating a file within `/home/jack/pumpkin/alohomora` we can execute any binary. From our previous encounter of privilege escalation we are going to create a binary named alohooa.

```

jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ echo "/bin/sh" > alohomora
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ chmod +x alohomora
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ sudo ./alohomora
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# whoami; id; cd root; cat *.txt
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

Hence, checking the root directory we can see a great art of pumpkin.
