   <p>I was a kid who was fascinated by CS since my childhood. Back in 2015-16, I started developing a MMO RPG which worked on <b>PHP/MYSQL</b>, which was my start in developing web applications, and back in 2018, I made by first step into cybersec, i loved finding flaws in web apps and reporting them, (I Still love making the internet secure).  </p>

       <p>Back in 2018 (June), I joined <b>Amrita University</b> for my undergraduation in <b>Computer Science</b> and is still pursuing my studies there. </p>
